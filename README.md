# Aphrodite's Odessey üíòüïπÔ∏è


Aphrodite‚Äôs Odyssey is a pixelated 2D action-adventure game that reimagines Greek mythology through a chaotic, vibrant dungeon-crawling lens. Inspired by the mythos of both Greek gods and the biblical tale of Jonah and the Whale, the story begins with the goddess Aphrodite awakening‚Äîconfused and alone‚Äîinside the belly of Cronus. Tasked by Zeus to stop an impending war on Mount Olympus, she must traverse three labyrinthine levels, defeat fearsome bosses rooted in ancient lore, and reclaim three divine artifacts: the Trident, the Helmet, and the Lightning Bolt.

Each level is a unique maze filled with patrolling mythological enemies like the Minotaur, Alecto, and Medusa. Players must outwit and outmaneuver these foes using stealth, speed, and eventually, divine power. Along the way, memory orbs unlock cinematic flashbacks revealing how Aphrodite became trapped in this nightmare‚Äîand what‚Äôs truly at stake.

Designed in Unity, the game draws stylistic inspiration from retro classics like Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros, while flipping expectations by placing a powerful female protagonist at the heart of an epic struggle.
